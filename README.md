A simple maze-based game. In the game, the player would control a character that they can move around a maze using the arrow keys on their keyboard. As they move through the maze, they must avoid obstacles and enemies and collect treasures. The goal of the game would be to reach the end of the maze and collect as many treasures as possible. To make the game more challenging, you could add power-ups and special abilities for the player to use, as well as more complex mazes and enemies. You could also include a scoring system and allow players to compete for the highest score on a leaderboard.
